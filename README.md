### Getting started

Create `.env` file with `APP=causecommune` or `APP=thinkerview` inside and `DSN=yourSecretDSNfromSentry`.

Run `make localizations` to generate new translations.

### Run the app

`flutter pub get`

Android & iOS :

`flutter run --flavor CauseCommune`

`flutter run --flavor Thinkerview`

macOS :

`flutter run -d macos`

Since flavors aren't supported by Flutter on macOS, there are some manual tasks in order to run and archive the app.

In `Project` -> `Runner` -> `Info` -> `Configurations` select for both Debug & Release either `Cause Commune` or `Thinkerview` in the Runner configuration set. Then `Clean Build Folder` inside `Product` menu of Xcode.

### Build app

Android :

`flutter build appbundle --flavor thinkerview`

`flutter build appbundle --flavor causecommune`

iOS and macOS, select project and archive on Xcode or :

`flutter build ios --flavor=Thinkerview`

`flutter build ios --flavor=CauseCommune`
